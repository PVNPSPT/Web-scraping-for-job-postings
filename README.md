# first_web_scraping
### Outline:
 1. Out of my tiredness to check the job websites for job postings and further filtering them for more relevant job titles, the thought of learning web scraping popped. With very first project I feel how easy, powerful, friendly Python is and especially **BeautifulSoup** module.
 2. The project has two parts: 
  1.  First part is about accepting two arguments from command line (job title, location), then scraping the monster website with those arguments and displaying the results as:
      1.Job title
      2.Company name
      3.Job location of every job posting.
   2. The second part is filtering the above results for most relevant job titles with apply links.
